# 2048 Game 

This repository contains a simple yet addictive implementation of the classic 2048 game developed using Python and the Tkinter library alongside python graphical user interfaces (GUIs) developed as a learning-hobby project.

## About the Game

2048 is a popular puzzle game where players slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048. The game is won when a tile with the number 2048 is created, but the player can continue playing to achieve higher scores by combining more tiles.

## Features

- **User Interface:** A visually appealing graphical interface created using Tkinter.
- **Game Mechanics:** Implementing the game's logic to slide tiles, merge them, and update the grid.
- **Scoring:** Tracking the current score and the highest tile achieved during gameplay.
- **Responsive Controls:** Allowing players to use arrow keys or GUI buttons for tile movements.
